# Opsmx Metric Provider for Argo Rollouts
Argo Rollouts enhances kubernetes Deployment with support for blue/green and Canary analysis as part of continuous deployment. Opsmx metric Provider supports ML/NLP based Log and Metric Analysis for these deployments.

This is a repo containing templates and files for using Argo Rollouts using OpsMx metric provider, provided as part of OpsMx's Integrated Delivery Platform (ISD). Instructions for installation and configuration can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZAd1YuyyvAMz7MtoytEP7IL0L4zy6iEgyVKcqHX4cQ0/edit?usp=sharing)

Following files are available.
1. Sample Rollout application in **sample-application** folder. This contains everything needed for getting started with the application rollout.
